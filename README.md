# AtModExplorer
### _An (empirical) atmospheric model explorer_
This is a project of the University of Colorado Space Environment Data Analysis Group (SEDA), a part of the Colorado Center for Astrodynamics Research (CCAR), and Aerospace Engineering Sciences (AES).

This tool was inspired by the similar IDL tool developed at National Center for Atmospheric Research's High Altitude Observatory (NCAR HAO) in 2003 as part of the CISM summer school.

### About 

The AtModExplorer is a PyQT4 based GUI for plotting results from the Naval Research Laboratory Mass-Spec and Incoherent Scatter Radar Model of the neutral atmosphere ([NRLMSISE00](http://www.nrl.navy.mil/research/nrl-review/2003/atmospheric-science/picone/)). This model is maintained by NRL.

This tool currently allows users to plot variables such as the mass density, temperature and number densities of various major atmospheric chemical constituants (O, O2, N, Ar, N2, etc.). It allows uses to plot these against various position coordinates such as latitude, longitude and altitude, on pseudocolor (heatmap) plots, line graphs, or on top of various map projections. 

### Installation

On linux systems, (tested so far on Ubuntu 14.04, running the Anaconda python distribution), first ensure you have the following dependancies:
* Gfortran (sudo apt-get install gfortran) 
* [PyQt4](http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download) (sudo apt-get install python-qt4)
* Numpy
* Matplotlib 
* Basemap (`pip install basemap` or `conda install basemap` if running anaconda)

**All of these dependancies can be satisfied by using the [Anaconda python distribution](http://continuum.io/downloads)**

* MsisPy - python (f2py wrapper) implementation of NRLMSISE00 

Then:
```{sh}
git clone https://github.com/lkilcommons/atmodexplorer.git
cd atmodexplorer
python setup.py install
```

### Running the GUI
Two ways:
1. From the command line:
```{sh}
run_atmodexplorer
```
2. From the python interpreter:
```{python}
import atmodexplorer
atmodexplorer.__init__()
```
